        <h1 >Permissions by Status (State)</h1>
        <p>Specific User Rights, during the timeframe of a Status, can be removed from selected User or Roles. The JustEnough Workflow State Manager also provides the ability remove User Rights during different Status States, for supported solutions.</p>
        <p>Status States provide an additional level of existence (e.g. sub-status) of the solution object (e.g. Event Slot Set progress or Promotion/Pricing validation). Each Status will have itâ€™s own set of States to restrict User Rights.</p>
