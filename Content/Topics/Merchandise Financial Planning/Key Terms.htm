        <h1 >Key Terms</h1>
        <p>The following terms appear throughout this manual. For the sake of keeping the size of manual as manageable as possible and to avoid breaking the flow of the information presented herein, a list of these terms and explanations of each is provided below for your reference.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Plan </span>– plans within Merchandise Financial Planning exist in a parent – child structure, with Master Plans being the top level parent; Master Plans are not directly editable by the user, but rather, are changed indirectly through the merging of approved Branch Plan data</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Plan</span> – Branch Plans are created from as children of a given Master Plan; multiple Branch Plans can exist beneath a Master Plan, allowing users to separate subsets of data for easier planning among multiple individuals on a planning team; Branch Plans can also be created from other Branch Plans, either containing the full data set for planning of different scenarios, or containing further subdivisions of data; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Plans are editable by users</span></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Merge </span>– refers to the pushing of data from a Branch Plan into a Master Plan; by default, merges into the parent Master Plan are initiated automatically when a child Branch Plan is approved, but merging can also be initiated manually</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accounting Method</span> – though Merchandise Financial Planning is a Hybrid solution, allowing for use of metrics typically associated with one method or the other in both, users must still select an Accounting Method that will serve as the basis for how inventory is valued and for calculating certain metrics, such as MMU (Maintained Markup); available accounting methods are Cost and Retail; <span style="font-weight: bold;">note that both cost and retail inventory metrics are available regardless of which accounting method is selected – there are simply differences in the way some of them are calculated</span></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost Accounting Method</span> – accounting method in which inventory units are valued at the average unit cost (AUC) for each period; notable differences between Cost and Retail methods are the way in which COGS, MMU, and Markdowns are calculated (see <span style="font-weight: bold;">Main Planning View &gt; Metric Details</span> below for more information)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Retail Accounting Method</span> – accounting method in which inventory units are valued at the average unit ticket price (AUT) for each period</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initialization </span>– the process of seeding a created plan with data from a user specified source so planning can begin; default seed types are Historic Sales LY, Historic Sales LLY, Forecasted Sales, and None (initializes a blank plan)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product Hierarchy – </span>the structure of product levels within an organization; a simple example is a 3 level Hierarchy with the levels Category, Gender, and Class, where the Categories are Apparel, Accessories, and Footwear, the Genders and Male and Female, and the Classes include things like knit tops, short sleeve tees, etc.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Hierarchy –</span> the structure of location levels within an organization; a simple example is a 3 level Hierarchy with the levels Company, Channel, and District, where Company represents all locations, the Channels are Retail, Wholesale, and Ecommerce, and Districts include things like Northwest, Southeast, etc.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Period </span>– the smallest unit of time being used within the assortment plan; typically, period represents a single week, however, it is also possible to plan in months or other periods as defined during your product implementation</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aggregation </span>– refers to the combination of lower levels of data within the plan; this is often accomplished via simple summation, as with Sales, Sales Units, and other quantitative metrics, however, the exact method of aggregation can change depending on the specific metric, and whether it is being aggregated across product and/or site hierarchy levels and time</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disaggregation </span>– refers to the splitting, or breaking down of aggregate values to their lower level components, be them lower levels of the product/site hierarchies and/or time periods; since plan values are stored at the lowest levels specified by the plan hierarchies, disaggregation is more accurately described as simply aggregation to lower levels than are shown in the current plan view, or in the case of the lowest hierarchy levels being present in the view, simply displaying the stored values</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Snapshot – </span>a save of the financial plan metric values at a specific point in time; used as comparison plans within the main planning view as a means of comparing prior plan states with your working plan.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Window of Time </span>– a contiguous range of periods used to define the data returned in a view or an analysis</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aggregation Level</span> – a user specified level at which data is pre-aggregated in the back end of JustEnough; this is done to improve system performance by reducing the number of data rows returned based on the lowest level of the product/site hierarchies at which the user wishes to work</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales by Type </span>– sales can be planned separately by type within Merchandise Financial Planning, allowing users to be more detailed about the circumstances under which they expect sales to occur; default types are regular, promotional, and markdown sales</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comp</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales </span>– though the exact timing of when stores becomes “comp” is managed outside of JustEnough, with site status being imported, generally speaking, this refers to sales occurring in stores that have been open at least one full year</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non</span>-<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comp Sales </span>– generally speaking, this refers to sales occurring in “new” stores that have been open for less than a full year</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pivot Grid </span>– Merchandise Financial Planning is based on Pivot Grid technology; similar to a Microsoft Excel Pivot Table, users can quickly rearrange the layout of the planning area, allowing for intuitive aggregations and groupings of meaningful chunks of data, however, unlike Pivot Tables, the JustEnough Pivot Grid is editable at any level for all plannable metrics</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock &amp; Spread </span>– functionality that allows users to freeze Sales and related metrics at levels of the plan, ensuring that they do not change, but rather, changes made are spread among unlocked levels</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calc </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Toggle</span> – refers to a set of predefined behaviors for dependent metrics when a given metric is changed by the user; multiple calc toggles are available for many plannable metrics within Merchandise Financial Planning, allowing the user to more easily fine tune plan details</li>
        </ul>
