        <h4 >Forecast Method and Method Fit</h4>
        <p>The forecast method name displayed will represent the tournament winner and its respective method fit based on MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). Using the forecast method drop-down list, users may view the results of the forecast tournament for that particular item. They will be ordered by their respective method fit scores. Any method with a result of 0.00% is considered to have been disqualified from the tournament and the reason for its disqualification will be listed in the “forecast message” column. </p>
        <p>Forecast parameters will display similar information to the details tab, but gives users an opportunity to compare the different methods at a glance.</p>
        <p>The forecast method fit is a <span style="color: #000000;">percentage value indicating how well a forecast method matches sales history. As part of the forecast tournament process, a method fit array is generated starting with the first sales history value and progressively determining what the forecast would have been with the selected method.&#160; This array and the actual sales history values for the same period are compared using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), to calculate a forecast model fit.</span></p>
        <p style="color: #000000;">Mean absolute percentage error is a common statistical measure of forecast accuracy and may be determined using the following formula:</p>
