        <h1 class="Heading1">Workflow State Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>The Workflow State Manager provides customers a method to configure solution specific lifecycles based on Status states. For each Status, Roles and individual Users may have certain permissions removed and reinstated, if applicable, within a following Status thus providing a method for cross team collaboration without overriding one another. </p>
        <p>Status Transitions are also configured to only permit specific Roles or individual Users to allow movement from one Status to next. A Workflow Status may also be configured to have multiple ‘next’ Statuses to allow for basic to multiple levels of approval states with the ability to push back to a previous ‘working’ status.</p>
        <p>Advanced validations and system actions may be configured by implementing Pre and Postfix methods to be executed for each Status to ensure corporate standards and policys are kept</p>
